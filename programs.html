1)Write a program to check whether  the number is divisible by 2 and 3 and both(take prompt)
Sol:

let number=parseInt(prompt("Enter a number"))
        if(number %2==0 && number %3==0){
            document.write("number is divisible by 2 and 3 both")

        }else{
            document.write("it is not divisible by 2 and 3 both")
        }
2)Write a program to find the largest number of three numbers expected from the user
Sol:
let a=parseInt(prompt("Enter a value : "))
      let b=parseInt(prompt("Enter b value : "))
       let c=parseInt(prompt("Enter c value : "))
       if(a>b && a>c){
        document.write(${a} is greater than b and c)
       }else if (b>a && b>c){
        document.write(${b} is greater than a and c)
       }else{
        document.write(${c} is greater than a and b)
       }
3)
 Accept the following from the user and calculate the percentage of class attended
a)Total no of working days
b)total no of days for absent
Ater calculating percentage show that if the percentage is less than 75, then student will not be eligible to write exam
Sol:
let a=parseInt(prompt("Enter the total number of working days: "))
        let b=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of days you were absent: "))
        let c=a-b
        let d=(c/a)*100
        if(d<75){
            document.write("You are not eligible to write the exam as your attendance percentage is "+d+"%")
        }else{
            document.write("You are eligible to write the exam as your attendance percentage is "+d+"%")
        }
